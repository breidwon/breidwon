## CPSC 120

* [Lab 6](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-06-ulises-and-bilal-1)

    Lab 6 part 2 was a standout because we got to make a blackjack game. We utilized multiple functions to create a fully functional game. I like how we kept the lab organized by making the funcitons and main game code in two seperate tabs.

* [Lab 11](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-11-bilal)
   
    Lab 11 part 1 stood out for me as the second favorite because it was the first code I did completely on my own. I ended up being absent the day of lab 11 so I was told to me in a group on my own. It took a lot of time and effort buyt I completed the lab with minimal problems throughout. 

* [Lab 2](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-02-ulises-and-bilal)
    
    Lab 2 part 1 was my third favorite because we used a our code knowledge to solve a math equation. This proves to be interesting to me because I know it is probably a very important skill when it comes to computer science. Also im really bad at math but somehow i had a good time creating this code.
